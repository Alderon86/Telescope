A TLDistributionMap is a visualization where the user specify a collection of container entities, how to get inner elements and a property to apply on those elements. It will create a map with big boxes for container; with small boxes (one for each inner entity) colored depending on the property.

Containers are put in the containers group (self > #containers)
